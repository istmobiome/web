These host-microbe interactions have played a fundamental role in the diversification, evolution and ecology of all animals on Earth. They may also play a crucial role for the future of biodiversity by mediating the effects of perturbations on individuals and communities of hosts. Considerable knowledge on the underpinnings of microbial symbiosis originates from integrative research programs on model systems (e.g., squid-vibrio, gutless worm), and there is an urgent need to understand if and how these concepts can be generalized across the tree of life.\nDuring this workshop we will summarize and synthesize the current state of our knowledge on the mechanisms and the role of animal-microbe interactions in the sea. As anthropogenic activities affect the dynamics of our oceans, we will discuss how the field can become more unified and predictive. How do we go about understanding the role of environmental stress on host-microbe interactions and the future of marine communities?\nThe result of these discussions will be summarized into a manuscript that will be submitted for peer-review in an international journal. All participants in the workshop will be invited to participate.\n","date":1541372400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1541372400,"objectID":"232a67eba72f36e558e78fe447878c5f","permalink":"/events/bocas-del-toro-panama-2018/","publishdate":"2018-11-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/events/bocas-del-toro-panama-2018/","section":"events","summary":"From model organisms to ecosystems\u0026#58; scaling-up our understanding of host-microbe symbiosis in the sea","tags":[],"title":"Marine Microbiome Workshop","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Flexibility This feature can be used for publishing content such as:\n Online courses Project or software documentation Tutorials  The courses folder may be renamed.

Bocas del Toro is an archipelago of six main islands and hundreds of mangrove islands of varying size. Dominant shallow water benthic habitats include the red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), seagrass (mainly Thalassia testudinum), and coral (e.g., Porites spp. \u0026amp; Agaricia spp.). The station is equipped with eight field boats, two field trucks, a full dive facility, numerous lab spaces, microscopy equipment, a seawater facility, and experimental tanks. There are two houses, eight research dorms, a student dorm, and a common kitchen/dinning hall. In addition to primary research activities that encompass both marine and terrestrial systmes, the station hosts undergraduate and graduate courses as well as taxonomy workshops.\nTransportation, accommodation, and meals will be provided to all participants. Any questions or inquiries about the logistics can be addressed to Fabiola Jenkins or Jarrod Scott.\nDrinking Water Do not drink untreated tap water in Bocas. There are special taps at the station that deliver clean drinking water. Bring a water bottle.\nSpending Money Cash rules in Bocas and there is only one ATM on the island. The currency in Panama is the USD.\nOutside Communication You can get WiFi in the houses, research dorms, labs, \u0026amp; dinning hall. Occasionally internet service does go out. WhatsApp is a great option for communicating back home \u0026amp; within Bocas. You can also get a local SIM card and a pay as you go data plan at the airport in Panama City or in Bocas. Ask us for more details if you are interested.\nClimate The climate in Bocas is mild. It does rain, sometime a lot. So plan accordingly or just plan on getting wet. You rarely need long sleeves \u0026amp; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really get too hot. That said, many of the labs at the station can be quite cool so you may want to pack a hoodie or something else to keep you comfortable when we are inside.\nHealth \u0026amp; Safety in Bocas Petty crime is the biggest safety concern in Bocas (well that and taxis drive entirely too fast). Be mindful of your belongings and you should be fine. There are many free roaming dogs around town but they are pretty mellow. Something is always under construction so mind your step when you are out and about. All in all, Bocas is generally a peaceful place.\nStuff to Bring In the field We are planning to spend some time in the field exploring local sites. We will be in boats, snorkeling, and scrambling around on shore (possibly in mangroves). If you are not interested in participating in these activities, please let one of the organizers know and we will arrange for an equally awesome alternative activity. To ensure your comfort and enjoyment please consider bringing the following items:\n Mask and snorkel Hat Water bottle Sunscreen Crocs, dive booties, Natives, old sneaks, etc. Sunglasses SPF 50 rash guard or other arm/shoulder protection Swim gear Camera Flip flops/sandals  If you don\u0026rsquo;t have some of these items, like a mask and snorkel, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it. We will sort you out\u0026mdash;just let us know what you need ahead of time.\nOther items Each dorm room has lockers for your personal effects. Please bring a Pad lock if you would like to use a locker.\nCuisine \u0026amp; Local Flavors The province of Bocas del Toro and surrounding islands are home to many cacao farms and chocolate makers. You can find cacao in several different forms including bars, nibs, powder, and raw beans. Be sure to talk to Luis Mejia (one of the workshop participants) about Theobroma cacao\u0026mdash;he is an expert on this amazing plant.\nIf you like spicy there is some awesome local hot sauce made with aji chombo (Capsicum chinense), a fiery Panamanian pepper similar in appearance to a habanero. Typical Panamanian food in not spicy but most restaurants will have some variation of hot sauce made with these peppers that you can slather on your food.\nThere are many cool varieties of fruit \u0026amp; vegetables available in Bocas including plantains, papaya, passionfruit, mango, rambutan, and naranjilla. And you can get some pretty dang good ceviche too.\nFor all intents and purposes, Panama has two national beers\u0026mdash;Panama and Balboa. There are also two different local spirits. Seco Herrerano, distilled from sugar cane, is often mixed with tropical fruits or milk (known as \u0026ldquo;seco con vaca\u0026rdquo;). Use at your own risk. More well known is Panama\u0026rsquo;s de facto national rum, Ron Abuelo, which is available in several ages. If you enjoy rum it is definitely worth a try.\n","date":1541372400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541372400,"objectID":"0b86e184a9aac1c25725554ee1519882","permalink":"/events/bocas-del-toro-panama-2018/important-details/","publishdate":"2018-11-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/events/bocas-del-toro-panama-2018/important-details/","section":"events","summary":"Venue The workshop will take place at the Bocas del Toro field station, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Republic of Panama.

Are some microbial taxa consistently found across hosts of a community? And are they functionally important or opportunistic taxa?\nHow to characterize the core microbiome of all hosts within a community (i.e., methodological considerations for comparative approaches)? How do marine hosts acquire this core community? How to account for environmental (oceanographic) factors impacting this core or masking the detection of the core community?\nDiscussion Questions 1A: What is a core microbiome? Group members, moderator, note taker/presenter\n1B: How to characterize the core microbiome? Group members, moderator, note taker/presenter\nReferences Outcomes 1A: What is a core microbiome?\nGroups 1 and 2\n What is a microbiome? All microbial organisms (e.g. bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, protozoans, and small microbial eukaryotes) “somehow” related/associated with an organism/host or found in a particular habitat/ecosystem in a given place and time.\n Is there a need to define/separate what is environmental microbiome, that is, the microbial community structure in a habitat (e.g. soil microbiome, water column microbiome) from host microbiome, that is, the microbial community structure associated to an organism (e.g. coral microbiome).\n What is the core microbiome? Microbes constantly (i.e. highly frequent and abundant/dominant) found in a habitat/host. In this sense, stability (i.e. taxon composition) and functionality of the microbial community is maintained within a defined scale.\n Is symbiosis between microbes and host a “must” to be considered as core microbiome? What about the environment? Is there a need to differentiate/define what is the “core taxonomic” (i.e. consistent microbial) members and “core functional” (i.e. genes or pathways) microbiome? Super organisms to neutral models, context dependent interactions.\n How can we tease a part and potentially quantify the direct and indirect effects of certain microbial groups/genes within the microbiome?\n Should use a metric(s) to define the core microbiome? Relative abundance (\u0026gt; a specific cut-off, e.g. 80%), spatial and temporal frequency (found in most samples or all samples), or simply presence/absence.\n Large microbiome picture: Community similarity analysis: gain and loss of taxonomic/functional core microbiome across different hosts through time. At what level the microbiome is shared in a given specific group (i.e. at the tips of the host phylogeny; species vs. higher taxonomic ranks). In addition, network analysis across different groups to characterize a particular habitat/system.\n What are some of the pros and cons associated to the concepts of microbiome and core microbiome?\n  1B: How to characterize the core microbiome?\nGroups 3 and 4\n How to characterize the core microbiome? In addition to the considerations on how we define the core microbiome, spatio-temporal variation is a key aspect when characterizing the core microbiome. The spatial component might give us an idea of “how common/spread ” such microbial taxa and associations are in a particular host/habitat, whereas the temporal component might inform us on how stable/frequent these associations are.\n Long-term studies are crucial to identify community patterns and also to detect drastic shifts.\n Baseline studies for different habitats/hosts and archiving material for future analyses can also advance our understanding. In addition, these baseline studies might direct us to more specific questions/goals.\n Taxonomic scale of both host and microbial taxa should be considered, potentially tested using different resolution levels. What taxonomic resolution should we be considering when characterizing microbiomes?\n Organism and ecosystem health should be evaluated, particularly the links between microbiome and their function\n Stability and variability (both in space and time) of the microbiome should be explored\n Mapping the landscape of the host/ecosystem (e.g. strata, body regions, organism geography/distribution), life stage, life history and other important aspects of the system. This would allow us to fully/properly characterize the microbiome. Additionally, a comparison between whole/integrated vs. partitioned microbiomes or microbiome/tissue specificity can be determined.\n How important is to characterize the background environmental (i.e. sediment, water, etc.) to understand the core microbiome of an organism? How do they acquire/select their microbiome?\n How to standardize sampling strategies for microbiome studies? The importance of standard protocols, particularly for worldwide scale studies (e.g. ZEN network).\n What is the importance of well-curate databases for microbiome studies? 16S, 18S, ITS datasets (who is there)? Who is there and what they potentially do?\n What sort of datasets should we be producing (e.g. metabarcoding/amplicon, transcriptomic, and metagenomics)? What are the other techniques we might consider to use (e.g. microscopy)?\n  Random Comments:\nOne comment I wanted to provide regarding core microbiome and healthy microbiome is that I think studies often don\u0026rsquo;t examine enough individuals to really address this question. Sample sets of hundreds of individuals provide much clearer patterns compared to only a handful of individuals. In corals and other highly permitted animals, it is often difficult to get access to these larger number of individuals, and we need managers and permitters to understand how necessary this is, especially today as ocean conditions (and likely microbiomes) will only change more in the future.\nAnother general comment\u0026hellip;I also see a trend in the journals and at meetings in that descriptive studies (such as core microbiome descriptions) are now often viewed as less important than those that provide more in-depth functional trends in symbiotic interactions. Yet, we still need descriptive studies in marine animal microbiome research! And these types of studies are perfect for training undergraduates and graduate students and provide context for other researchers to establish new projects upon. I am not sure how to change the culture, but perhaps this is a point that could be make in the Outcome article that descriptive studies are still incredibly valuable.\nSchedule 0700\u0026ndash;0830 Breakfast 0900\u0026ndash;1200 Topic 1 Jarrod will get Becky from the airport\n0900\u0026ndash;0915 Introduction to Topic 1 (Jarrod)\n0915\u0026ndash;1015 Break-out groups  1A: What is a core microbiome? 1B: How to characterize the core microbiome?  1015\u0026ndash;1045 Break 1045\u0026ndash;1115 Report and discuss ideas from topics\n1115\u0026ndash;1200 Summary and discussion of morning sessions\n1200\u0026ndash;1630 Field trip with lunch in the field\n1630\u0026ndash;1730 Debrief\n1800\u0026ndash;1930 Dinner 1930\u0026ndash;2100 Evening Discussion\n Discuss sampling strategies from in the field.

The breakdown of mutualistic relationships can cascade through entire ecosystems with devastating effects on biodiversity and ecological services. Emerging evidence suggests that a set of environmental conditions must be met to initiate the switch from beneficial to detrimental interactions. For example, temperature anomalies beyond some number of days lead to the exclusion of zooxanthellae by host corals. In the case of corals, a well-studied system, symbionts consume too much sugar and get expelled from the host when temperature rises. There is a fine line between mutualism and parasitism.\nExisting studies of microbial communities on marine hosts highlight in most cases: 1) a great diversity of microbial partners (i.e., one host - one microbe such as interactions highlight the squid-vibio model are not the norm); 2) some hosts have much more diverse microbiomes than others (e.g., within sponges and corals). The significant of these large differences in diversity is not well understood but microbial diversity (both alpha and beta) might have an import role in host fitness and stability in changing environmental conditions.\nGeneral Discussion Is a higher richness of microbes beneficial to a host? Do diverse associations promote host fitness and stable holobionts in changing environmental conditions?\nHow to identify the tipping point from symbiosis to dysbiosis in host-associated microbiomes (beyond corals-zooxanthellae)? How to differentiate microbial imbalance from natural variations in microbiomes (e.g., driven by seasonality, changes in diet and life history events)? What is a healthy microbiome?\nDiscussion Questions 2A: What is a healthy microbiome? Does microbial diversity matter for the host? Is more microbes better? Or fewer beneficial symbionts?

Group members, moderator, note taker/presenter\nOutcomes Tipping points (from healthy to unhealthy microbiomes)  Stability, similarity in the microbiome in time and space, that is, the community structure. Does healthy microbiome mean stable? Different timing points might show different community structure (e.g. uniqueness, complete distinctness).\n Disruption of the community structure might increase diversity which in turn can also lead to an unstable/unhealthy system, that is, high diversity does not always mean healthier microbiome\n How can we evaluate these tipping points? Dispersion analysis, estimating variance?\n Should we consider host and microbial regulations, trade-offs in the system? How to measure the impacts on the host (e.g. host growth, metabolism, density in the environment)\n Dysbiosis not always lead unhealthy/mortality\n Importance of associating host/microbiome changes with environment variables, so we can predict tipping points between healthy to unhealthy microbiome\n Can we define a set of conditions in the environment to predict tipping points (e.g. nutrients, temperature, etc.)?\n Resilience/Succession in microbiome (prior, during, and post disturbance, e.g. antibiotic usage). If the system is prone to tipping, often the system cannot recover, how can we test that?\n Can/should we quantify tipping points in the microbiome? Soil microbiome literature seems to be rich in this aspect\n Multi stressors should be evaluated when evaluating healthy microbiomes and tipping points\n To what degree microbiomes assemble because the host is controlling the system and to what the degree the microbiomes are the controllers (assembly and disassembly of microbiomes)\n What is the outcome of tipping points? Does it always lead to dysbiosis?\n Example of dysbiosis in bats seem to show how unbalance their microbial community was and how affected the host health.\n Adaptable communities to couple with potential changes\n Key functional traits need to be maintained\n Diversity is not always good, since it can make the system unstable\n Relative abundance is not always a good metric (not always functionally active)\n Different ways to measure diversity, species richness, beta and alpha diversity, functional diversity\n Healthy microbiomes are not always ease to be determined, but relative. Should we move away from it?\n There is also short term and long term issues related to microbiome and what is a healthy microbiome. Ecological and evolutionary time scales should be considered.\n Total metrics, without teasing a part the potential subgroups can mask some important patterns\n Stable as predictable/predictability\n Complete dysbiosis can also occur (quiescence can be an alternative as well).\n  Schedule 0700-0830 Breakfast 0900\u0026ndash;1200 Topic 2 0900\u0026ndash;0915 Introduction to Topic 2 (Laetitia/Matt)\n0915\u0026ndash;1015 Break-out groups  2A: **What is a healthy microbiome? ** Does microbial diversity matter for the host?
