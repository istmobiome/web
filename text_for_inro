The Great TransIsthmian Experiment

a microbial tale told by two oceans
Some 3 million years ago, a spectacular natural experiment began when the
Isthmus of Panama finally closed, a process that began several million years earlier.



For terrestrial organisms, the formation of the Isthmus connected North & South
America, allowing for massive migrations of plants & animals.



For marine organisms, the story unfolded quite differently. Where once a single
tropical ocean flowed, the land bridge became a marine barrier, altering ocean
currents & causing different physicochemical environments to emerge.





These radically different conditions are reflected in the resident benthic communities.
Many species went locally extinct after the Isthmus closed (e.g., coral, fish, bivalves).


Yet pairs of closely related sister species (geminates) thrive on either side. Some of
these species pairs are so similar that morphology alone is not enough to tell them apart.

What effect did the rise of the Isthmus have on microbes?




In this project, we exploit contrasting (a) geographic regions, (b)
benthic habitats, & (c) gradients to understand the evolutionary
divergence of marine microbiomes in changing environments &
their functional significance in different systems.




This study centers on two geographic regions:
Isla Coiba in the EP & the Bocas del Toro archipelago
in the WA. The boxes on the main map of Panama
highlight the sampling regions for this study.



From each region we looked at benthic water samples
associated with both coral & mangrove habitats.


For your convenience, we follow the above color
scheme throughout the presentation.
