Welcome. This page provides a link to the <em>external</em> website for our study on the intestinal microbiome of herbivorous reef fish entitled <em>Intestinal microbes: as axis of functional diversity among large marine consumers</em>. Microbes are ubiquitous throughout the worldâ€™s ocean yet the extent of their influence on the ecology and evolution of large, mobile fauna is poorly understood.

SYNOPSIS
<hr>
In this study, we

- Conducted field observations, which showed that five common Caribbean fish species display marked differences in where they feed and what they feed on.
- Used 16S rRNA amplicon analysis of intestinal microbiomes from 50 individual fish across the 5 species to show a high degree of species-specific composition.
- Performed phylogenetic comparison of  dominant microbiome members to show that intestinal microbiome are a mixture of  environmental generalists, animal-associates, and fish-specialists.
- Found that the closest relatives of fish-specialists were microbes from intestines of ecologically and evolutionarily related fishes in other, distant oceans.
