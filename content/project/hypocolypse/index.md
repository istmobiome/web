Welcome. This page provides a link to the <em>external</em> website for our study on hypoxia-driven coral bleaching & microbial shifts in Caribbean Panama. Ocean deoxygenation poses a serious threat to marine ecosystems, but has only recently been identified as a critical, emerging stressor in tropical ecosystems. Despite the catastrophic implications, the effects of oxygen-loss on coral reefs and associated microbial communities remains poorly understood.

SYNOPSIS
<hr>
In this study, we

- Targeted two sites during the Bocas del Toro hypoxic event of 2017.
- One normoxic site & one hypoxic site, both during and after the event.
- Conducted extensive field measurements to quantify environmental conditions &  corresponding effects on coral physiology.
- Used 16S rRNA amplicon & metagenomic sequencing determine the effects of hypoxia on microbial communities.
