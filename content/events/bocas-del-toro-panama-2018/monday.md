Welcome to Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) and the Bocas del Toro research station. The program for the afternoon session is pretty straightforward. We will begin with a brief overview of the workshop, discuss the importance of the Isthmus of Panama, and tell you a bit about the project that inspired this workshop.

The purpose of this session is to introduce you to past, present, and future work at STRI. STRI has over 40 permanent staff scientists and hosts over a thousand  visiting researchers every year. Research at STRI spans many disciplines---from Archaeology and Paleobiology to Neurobiology and Microbial Ecology---across a spectrum of tropical systems. You can find scientists climbing in the canopy of a massive tree or diving on a beautiful coral reef.

STRI's research assests are as diverse as it's science. The Institute maintains 11 permenant research and educational facilities, including a tiny field station at Fortuna in the cloud forests of Panama's highlands and a new state of the art facility in Gamboa on the Panama Canal.
