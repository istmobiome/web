## Overview

Our understanding of host-microbe interactions is known in great depth from a very few number of “simple” study systems (i.e., squid-vibrio, lucinid clams, Atlantic killfish, *Olavius oligochaete*) and a larger number of foundation species (i.e., corals, sponges). Assuming that between 0.3 and 2.2 million metazoan species live in the ocean, our knowledge about host-microbe interactions is based upon 0.03% and 0.004% of all marine host species only (they fall in 5 out of 32 phyla living in the ocean).

Expanding the breath of host-microbe studies
On what taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional groups should future studies on symbiosis be focusing and why?

## Discussion Questions

#### What have we learned from these systems?

#### Why are some systems being studied more than others?

#### On what taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional groups should future studies on symbiosis be focusing and why?

#### Play a game with the group: If you could pick 10 organisms to study, how would you pick them? Why?

#### Can we study hosts in aquaria without disrupting their symbioses, or are field studies necessary?

#### How can a system be studied with a more systematic approach? How deep do you have to study a system? Where should we prioritize research?
