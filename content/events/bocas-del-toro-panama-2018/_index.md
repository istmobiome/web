### From model organisms to ecosystems&#58; scaling-up our understanding of host-microbe symbiosis in the sea


December 3--8 2018<br/>
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute<br/>
Bocas del Toro Research Station, Panama<br/>

## Motivation

Animals serve as ecosystems for a suite of bacteria, archaea, viruses and fungi with which they interact in various ways. These host-microbe interactions have played a fundamental role in the diversification, evolution and ecology of all animals on Earth. They may also play a crucial role for the future of biodiversity by mediating the effects of perturbations on individuals and communities of hosts. Considerable knowledge on the underpinnings of microbial symbiosis originates from integrative research programs on model systems (e.g., squid-vibrio, gutless worm), and there is an urgent need to understand if and how these concepts can be generalized across the tree of life.

During this workshop we will summarize and synthesize the current state of our knowledge on the mechanisms and the role of animal-microbe interactions in the sea. As anthropogenic activities affect the dynamics of our oceans, we will discuss how the field can become more unified and predictive. How do we go about understanding the role of environmental stress on host-microbe interactions and the future of marine communities?

The result of these discussions will be summarized into a manuscript that will be submitted for peer-review in an international journal. All participants in the workshop will be invited to participate.
