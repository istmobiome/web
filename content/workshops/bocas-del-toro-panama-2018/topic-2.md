## Overview

The magnitude and frequency of environmental stressors are impacting the dynamics of host microbe interactions. The breakdown of mutualistic relationships can cascade through entire ecosystems with devastating effects on biodiversity and ecological services. Emerging evidence suggests that a set of environmental conditions must be met to initiate the switch from beneficial to detrimental interactions. For example, temperature anomalies beyond some number of days lead to the exclusion of zooxanthellae by host corals. In the case of corals, a well-studied system, symbionts consume too much sugar and get expelled from the host when temperature rises. There is a fine line between mutualism and parasitism.

Existing studies of microbial communities on marine hosts highlight in most cases: 1) a great diversity of microbial partners (i.e., one host - one microbe such as interactions highlight the squid-vibio model are not the norm); 2) some hosts have much more diverse microbiomes than others (e.g., within sponges and corals). The significant of these large differences in diversity is not well understood but microbial diversity (both alpha and beta) might have an import role in host fitness and stability in changing environmental conditions.

## General Discussion

Is a higher richness of microbes beneficial to a host? Do diverse associations promote host fitness and stable holobionts in changing environmental conditions?

How to identify the tipping point from symbiosis to dysbiosis in host-associated microbiomes (beyond corals-zooxanthellae)? How to differentiate microbial imbalance from natural variations in microbiomes (e.g., driven by seasonality, changes in diet and life history events)? What is a healthy microbiome?

## Discussion Questions

#### 2A: What is a healthy microbiome? Does microbial diversity matter for the host? Is more microbes better? Or fewer beneficial symbionts?

## Outcomes


### Tipping points (from healthy to unhealthy microbiomes)

1. Stability, similarity in the microbiome in time and space, that is, the community structure. Does healthy microbiome mean stable? Different timing points might show different community structure (e.g. uniqueness, complete distinctness).

2. Disruption of the community structure might increase diversity which in turn can also lead to an unstable/unhealthy system, that is, high diversity does not always mean healthier microbiome

3. How can we evaluate these tipping points? Dispersion analysis, estimating variance?

4. Should we consider host and microbial regulations, trade-offs in the system? How to measure the impacts on the host (e.g. host growth, metabolism, density in the environment)

5. Dysbiosis not always lead unhealthy/mortality

6. Importance of associating host/microbiome changes with environment variables, so we can predict tipping points between healthy to unhealthy microbiome

7. Can we define a set of conditions in the environment to predict tipping points (e.g. nutrients, temperature, etc.)?

8. Resilience/Succession in microbiome (prior, during, and post disturbance, e.g. antibiotic usage). If the system is prone to tipping, often the system cannot recover, how can we test that?

9. Can/should we quantify tipping points in the microbiome? Soil microbiome literature seems to be rich in this aspect

10. Multi stressors should be evaluated when evaluating healthy microbiomes and tipping points

11. To what degree microbiomes assemble because the host is controlling the system and to what the degree the microbiomes are the controllers (assembly and disassembly of microbiomes)

12. What is the outcome of tipping points? Does it always lead to dysbiosis?

13. Example of dysbiosis in bats seem to show how unbalance their microbial community was and how affected the host health.

14. Adaptable communities to couple with potential changes

15. Key functional traits need to be maintained

16. Diversity is not always good, since it can make the system unstable

17. Relative abundance is not always a good metric (not always functionally active)

18. Different ways to measure diversity, species richness, beta and alpha diversity, functional diversity

19. Healthy microbiomes are not always ease to be determined, but relative. Should we move away from it?

20. There is also short term and long term issues related to microbiome and what is a healthy microbiome. Ecological and evolutionary time scales should be considered.

21. Total metrics, without teasing a part the potential subgroups can mask some important patterns

22. Stable as predictable/predictability

23. Complete dysbiosis can also occur (quiescence can be an alternative as well).

#### 1700--1830

General discussion How do we progress from surveying the microbiome to modeling it? How do we move from defining variation to understanding what is driving it?


#### 1830--1930 Dinner

After dinner social mixing, relaxing, resting, individual time.

#### 19:30--

For those interested Laetitia will organize a voluntary session on modeling the null model of microbial colonization of a host that night.

We need a theoretical framework that simulates how a Null hypothesis would look like. In the case of microbiomes this is a distribution of microorganisms (in a simple case just 16S reads) on hosts that does not follow any form of coevolution with the host. Just random assemblages that follow rules of colonization, migration, drift and mutation.
