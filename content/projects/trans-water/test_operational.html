<p>Directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the metagenomic workflow where edge connections represent dependencies and nodes represent commands. The workflow begins with raw data (trimmed of Illumina adapters) and continues up to and including automatic binning of contigs. At the end of this workflow we then proceed with manual binning and MAG generation. For simplicity, only 2 samples from the Eastern Pacific &amp; 2 samples from the Western Atlantic are shown.</p>
