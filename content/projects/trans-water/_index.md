There are some important abbreviations we use throughout this site that describe different sample types. Our samples come from two oceans and two habitats within each ocean, denoted as follows:

#### Oceans:
* Eastern Pacific = EP
* Western Atlantic = WA

#### Habitats:
* Eastern Pacific Mangrove = EPM
* Eastern Pacific Reef = EPR
* Western Atlantic Mangrove = WAM
* Western Atlantic Reef = WAR

Additional abbreviations will be described as the need arises.
