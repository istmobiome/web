## How to Navigate this Site

Think of a this as a website within a website. On the left side is the **Project Menu**, which lists the main topics of the site. Within most topics is an additional menu on the right side that contains conecpts within a given topic. You can return to the main page anytime to access quick links by hitting the **Project Home Page** link in the upper left or you can access main site pages using the navigation bar above.

<br/>

{{% alert synopsis %}}
There are a few important abbreviations we use throughout this site that describe different sample types. Our samples come from two oceans and two habitats within each ocean, denoted as follows:

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <h4>Ocean</h4>
    <p>Eastern Pacific = EP </br>
    Western Atlantic = WA</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <h4>Habitat</h4>
    <p>Eastern Pacific Mangrove = EPM </br>
    Eastern Pacific Reef = EPR </br>
    Western Atlantic Mangrove = WAM </br>
    Western Atlantic Reef = WAR</p>
  </div>
</div>

Additional abbreviations will be described as the need arises.

1) **Software**: How we installed all software used in the workflow.
2) **Databases**: How we built annotation databases.

1) **Assembly & Annotations**: How we assembled and annotated the datasets.
2) **Data Summary**: Summary analysis of assemblies and annotations.
