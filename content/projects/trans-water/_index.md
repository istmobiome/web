{{% alert synopsis %}}
There are some important abbreviations we use throughout this site that describe different sample types. Our samples come from two oceans and two habitats within each ocean, denoted as follows:

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <h4>Ocean</h4>
    <p>Eastern Pacific = EP </br>
    Western Atlantic = WA</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <h4>Habitat</h4>
    <p>Eastern Pacific Mangrove = EPM </br>
    Eastern Pacific Reef = EPR </br>
    Western Atlantic Mangrove = WAM </br>
    Western Atlantic Reef = WAR</p>
  </div>
</div>

Additional abbreviations will be described as the need arises.
